Who am I exactly? It's a question with many answers of varying accuracy.

## The Business Answer

  I'm a front-end developer working at [SeeClickFix](https://seeclickfix.com/) and living in New Haven. My focuses are CSS, JavaScript, and web accessibility.

  I also write about programming. I often write to explain tough topics, like git rebasing and functional JavaScript, in simple and weird ways, like with cupcakes or angels and mutants.

  In my free time I enjoy reading, boxing, making things at MakeHaven, casual gaming, and pondering the philosophical.

## The Healthy Answer

I am not an influencer, thought leader, aggregator, or well-known in any sense. I am myself, and I'm more than enough that way.

I’m a guy trying (and often failing) to figure it all out. I happen to have a blog. I ponder obscure stuff. Sometimes I write useful things thanks to the law of averages. But I enjoy writing them, so I can be a little better for the next day.

At the end of the day, I can afford a home, food, bed, and a few luxuries to entertain myself. If I'm lucky, I'll have something left over for a few donations. People want more than that, but does anyone need more?

Here's to a good, simple life.

## The Toxic Answer

I sometimes write in my spare time. When I do, I need people to read and give positive feedback, or else it's worthless. If I don't get any, it takes weeks until I pluck up the courage to write again. My value comes back to how much praise, social capital, and economic power my life brings. That includes my time for entertainment or rest.

If people aren't lining up to watch a live stream of me reading a book, I'm a failure. If I can't sell it or put ads on it, it isn't worth doing or enjoying.

## The Personal Answer

I try to live my life based on a few values. The most important ones are curiosity and empathy. Curiosity keeps me learning new things and finding new experiences, either on my own or shared by others. Empathy lets me expand my range of feelings and understanding as I go along.

These values take the form of exploring new ways to craft accessible websites, reading about life through others' eyes or the invisible systems driving society, or trying to process all the above with what I write. They bring my life joy and pain in equal measure. When I go to sleep, I don't often feel happy. But [I feel fulfilled, that I did something meaningful with my time](https://www.maxwellantonucci.com/posts/2017/05/16/2017-5-15-perfectly-unhappy-developer/). That's what I want more in the end.

To throw myself into the confusing turmoil of existence, get spit out, dust myself off, feel a little stronger, and throw myself right back in.
## The Absurd Answer

I'm an agent sent from an alternate plane of reality, where human thought and imagination circulate through the world like air. People add to it whenever they ponder or daydream, and take from it when sudden inspiration strikes.

It's a place full of ludicrous creations and unexpected dangers. Most of us will never see it, even though we're the ones fueling it. But I see it and fight to keep it separate. Otherwise fantasy and reality could combine into something deadlier than we could ever...well, imagine.

## The Million Dollar Answer

The word "tabby," now used to refer to a cat, is derived from the word Al-'Attābīya, the name of a district in the city of Baghdad.
