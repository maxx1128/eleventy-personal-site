title: "Excessive Books are Okay"

While I mostly agree with Konmari's principle of only keeping what "sparks joy," my only exception is books. Books will always spark joy, even if books I've read a lot need a long break before they spark it again.

Plus, does anything spark more joy than getting lots of books for only $9.50 at a library book sale?

Technically some things do spark more joy than that, but they're all illegal in this state and I don't know any dealers.
