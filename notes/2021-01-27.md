To my fellow manga readers out there, I ask this serious question: would Shinichi Sakurai and Hana Uzaki from "Uzaki-chan wants to Hang Out!" actually make a good couple?

It could be many things: the huge height difference, the childish personality, or the condescending attitude bordering on narcissism, but I don't see it. Uzaki strikes me more as an annoying cousin that never shuts up than a romantic partner.

The good news is if the series is popular enough, it will either never end or end on an ambiguous "they're kinda together but not quite" note. So they'll never get together and I'll be vindicated.
