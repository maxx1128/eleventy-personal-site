Older generations often get mad at younger generations like Millennials for having different values. These range from the serious to the trivial, such as:

* [Not proposing with diamonds for financial or ethical reasons](http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-have-millennials-fallen-out-of-love-with-diamonds).
* [Marrying later in life (and coincidentally lowering the divorce rate)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-04/young-americans-are-killing-marriage).
* [Choosing chicken parmesan as their seduction food of choice](https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/how-chicken-parm-became-nycs-aphrodisiac-of-choice/).
* [Avoiding casual dining chains for delivery or cooking at home](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-endanger-casual-dining-restaurants-2017-5).
* [Destroying the very fabric of American society](https://medium.com/thingsthatmatterblog/millennials-are-killing-america-part-one-81c802bd8437).
* [Killing cereal, apparently due to sheer laziness](https://fortune.com/2016/02/25/millennials-cereal-sales/). ([Although the real reason we're cereal killers is less time to eat](https://www.gq.com/story/the-real-reason-millennials-arent-eating-cereal-for-breakfast).)

I don't know if any of these value shifts are good or not. I do know older generations shouldn't assume they're bad or shouldn't happen.

The reason is simple - **values changing between generations is how society grows.** This repeating pattern of change-anger-acceptance isn't new and isn't going away.
