A while back [I wrote about Saturday nights](https://www.maxwellantonucci.com/notes/2018-11-03.html). How it's foolish to think everyone is partying or having a golden time during them, since every other type of event is also happening.

On a related note, there's lots of things one _can do_ on a weekend. But there's a lot fewer things one _wants to do_ on it too.

**As long as I find something I want to do, not partying or doing stereotypical twenty-something activities is fine with me.**
