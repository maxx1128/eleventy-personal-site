According to the various romantic comedy books Iâ€™ve read, men need the following things for love:

* Being at least six feet tall. It pairs best with a woman that's under five feet and four inches tall.
* A six-pack described with any of the following words: chiseled, defined, sculpted, steamy, polished, rock-solid, or impossible to look away from.
* A penis so large that it makes their partner gape in awe at it at first sight. That's despite it being one of the weirdest and most unremarkable parts of the human anatomy.

I hereby challenge any romance author out there to write a compelling, entertaining, and sexy romantic comedy novel with the male lead that doesn't meet _any_ of these requirements. I'll wait.
