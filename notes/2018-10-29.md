title: "A Form of Immortality"
---

I recently spoke to someone who, even though they're an atheist, is unsure about their beliefs about reincarnation. After the death of a loved family member, this person took their lessons and ideas to heart. In a weird way, they felt like a reincarnation of their loved one. Other family members even commented on how their actions, ideas, and even mannerisms are similar. Was it reincarnation or just their memories?

I don't believe in literal reincarnation myself, and told them so. But I believe their actions are a way to keep their family member alive. Remembering this person's positive influence means, even indirectly, they're still affecting the world like before. **Their family member still exists, even if it's limited to their memories of them.**

Isn't that, in its own way, a form of reincarnation and immortality? Carrying a loved one with you instead of waiting for them to reappear?
