I used to think that "who we want to be" is less important than "who we are." But why wouldn't it? Isn't who we want to be an expression of our desires, goals, motivation, and the path we choose to walk?

Maybe we won't ever become that person we want to, but chasing it will make it better. That desire changes "who we are" for the better. It's still a major part of our identity.

So if you're chasing something and think you'll never reach it, I recommend chasing it anyway. It's always worth getting a little closer.
