You'd think America would be in a constant uproar of outrage and grief knowing that thousands of painful yet preventable deaths had been hitting us for months. [According to this article, the fact we aren't is a sign we're in collapse.](https://gen.medium.com/i-lived-through-collapse-america-is-already-there-ba1e4b54c5fc)

> People suffering, dying, and protesting all around you, while you think about dinner. If you’re trying to carry on while people around you die, your society is not collapsing. It’s already fallen down.

Does this mean we, as individuals, aren't allowed to enjoy ourselves in a time of crisis?

Maybe it depends on how our enjoyment lines up with the crisis itself. In a pandemic, that's getting joy from overcrowded parties and in-person gatherings. It's clinging to normal in ways that sustain, or even worsen, the misery of those who are sick, unemployed, isolated, or in grief.

**If a majority of Americans are using their privilege and status to act like nothing is wrong and this will "resolve itself" without any sacrifice on their part, then I'd agree with this article. Our society has already collapsed.**

The still-increasing winter spike of deaths and cases, due to people gathering when they were told not to, seems to confirm it is.
