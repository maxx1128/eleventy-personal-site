I'm not too scared of death. No amount of panic will let me avoid death, so I may as well accept it. I'm more scared of having a boring death.

To me, a worthwhile death is either memorable or one that helps others. If my death is both spectacular and considerate, I'll have few regrets. Even if it's painful, the pain is temporary (I hope) while the legacy lasts much longer.

Not to say I want to die anytime soon. But I may as well know how I'd want it to happen.
