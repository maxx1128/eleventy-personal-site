Which came first, the decrease in writing or the decrease in self-esteem?

I'd argue it doesn't matter, since regardless of order, the result is a downward spiral of both.

The best way to break this cycle is writing anything, even if it hurts. As long as it build momentum and carries the self-esteem up with it.

I wrote before about [good writing being a habit](https://www.maxwellantonucci.com/notes/2018-08-27.html). I didn't write about how if I let my guard down at all, those habits will shrivel up and die off.
