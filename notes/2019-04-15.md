Most people know that, as children, we may have repressed memories into our unconscious mind. This seems obvious enough today, but thinking about it now, I find it unsettling. Someone's immature brain basically said "this kid can't handle this memory, better hide it from them and maybe reveal it later."

Someone brain made a decision separate from whoever owned the brain itself, with maturity the owner lacked. Honestly, **how different is this from a random adult reaching into our brains and making the change for us?**

The worst part is, this could be happening all the time and we'd never be consciously aware of it. We could wake up one day, all our unconscious memories flooding to the surface, and realize our entire lives were a lie.

Happy Spring, everyone!
