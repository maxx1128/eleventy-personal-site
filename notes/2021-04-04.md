I'm still cynical about escaping this pandemic. I'm anxious about variants winning the race against vaccines, states re-opening too early, and younger people being reckless in large crowds. This is the country talking about entering a "fourth wave." In reality, we're still in a fluctuating first wave.

But after getting my first vaccine dose, I'm feeling a little better. **Amid all the bad news out of my control, I've got some good news in my control.** After a whole year of this, each bit of good helps.
