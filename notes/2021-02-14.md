After a serious discussion with my distinguished colleagues, we reached this conclusion: **there must be a circle of Hell where you do Satan's chores**.

These include cleaning his laundry, mopping blood off the hardwood floors, cooking meals of burnt flesh and hot sauce, and doing his taxes. At first, I wasn't sure if people did taxes in Hell. Then someone pointed out that there are arguably more taxes in Hell than Earth because taxes *are* Hell. If anything, Hell needs more people to handle everyone's taxes, including Satan's.

But one question remains: what circle of Hell does all this domestic labor happen? How far down the sinning scale is doing Satan's dusting or dropping off his library books?

More research is needed.
