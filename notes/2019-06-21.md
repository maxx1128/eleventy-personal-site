Dating sites need a section for favorite philosophers. Mostly to avoid people who like Immanuel Kant. These people have many beliefs that don't work in romance:

* If they don't "intend" to offend others, they get a free pass.
* They're unwilling to compromise on ANYTHING.
* They won't lie and say you look good, even if you don't. Which I personally know is a big red flag.

Always ask on the first date if they like Kant. If they do, just run.
