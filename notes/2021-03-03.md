You may ask why I'm writing about a shark with retractable forehead genitals. To that, I say, **why *aren't* you writing about a shark with retractable forehead genitals.** Indeed, why aren't you looking for as many reasons as possible to repeat the phrase "retractable forehead genitals?"

I am because I know how to embrace life!

Thank you for taking some time for the Ghost Shark with retractable forehead genitals. Please go about your day.
