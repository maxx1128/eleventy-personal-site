An eFriend of mine pointed out how many people in a group chat don't often write something productive. Instead, they often talked in circles, shared few facts or insights, and more often seemed just liked reading their own words.

So for the record, productive conversations mean accepting there are smarter people worth taking advice from. Even if (perhaps especially if) you're a man and the smarter people are women.
