We can leave it to manga to make everyday things our body does into something badass.

Let's take one of my favorites, _[Cells at Work: Code Black](https://kodanshacomics.com/series/cells-at-work-code-black/)._ One scene is, on its face, just someone getting gout. The make it compelling by mixing in existential crises, violent protests against a faceless and abusive ruling body (pun intended), and cries of despair to the heavens. All as it explains the basics of gout and its treatment.

There are times where, despite my love of manga, I struggle to love it. It's mostly due to the high amount of smutty, fanservice content one sees. Especially when fanservice gets in the way of an otherwise good story and characters.

But then I read a manga chapter that almost always brings me to tears while talking about uric acid and colchicine. Moments like that remind me why manga is worth fighting for.
