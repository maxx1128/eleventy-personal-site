* **Good people who feel big** try to lift up others, wanting to share the joy.
* **Bad people who feel big** try to push others down, terrified to lose their spot.
* **Good people who feel small** try to climb up, helping others when they can.
* **Bad people who feel small** try to drag others down, finding "joy" in spreading their misery.

We can't always control how big or small we feel in the world. At least we can choose not to be an asshole about it.
