title: "How to Make an Anime Woodblock"
---

When bored, I've defaulted to this question: **"What interesting thing can I make today with anime images I find online?"**

This time around, I answered by laser-cutting one of these images into a woodblock as a gift. It's possible with four easy steps!

First, find a good image with a simple background.

Second, remove its color and increase the contrast.

Third, use Inkscape to convert the image into several SVG vector layers. Pick out the best ones, change them to either pure green or yellow, and place them on an image canvas. Add in other elements like a quote or a sun.

Fourth, plug it all into a laser cutter, put in a standing woodblock, hit start, and pray it comes out okay.

Once all the above are done, dance into the night in celebration!
