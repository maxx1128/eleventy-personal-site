This Calvin and Hobbes comic breaks down America's economic and cultural system pretty well in about eight panels.

![A comic about the ways society creates superficial wants to make us feel dissatisfied with life.](/assets/images/notes/in-the-mail-comic.jpg)

My only disagreement is this: would there be anarchy if an economy based on artificial desires collapsed? Or would a new system based on human needs, compassion, and simplicity emerge to take its place?

Instead, maybe we don't know what that new system would be like, and confuse that lack of knowledge with anarchy. The fact that we've never been taught of, or had any real exposure to, that kind of system bothers me the most. Next to the fact that many people claim that's what our current system somehow is.
