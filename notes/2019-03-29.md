With all the React Week tweet drama, there were lots of people trying to explain it. One aspect I had a really hard time explaining was:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is it really so tough to say “I’m sorry for what was written, I was unaware how it was offensive, so we have removed it and put in place measures (like a CoC) to prevent it from happening again?<br><br>Or are some male egos too fragile to admit fault when women criticize them?</p>&mdash; Max Antonucci (@Maxwell_Dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/Maxwell_Dev/status/1110536531129892864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

I personally don't find it hard accepting lots of women are smarter than me. I grew up with two such women, read blog posts of such women, and have been rejected by even more of such women.

I have an unfair advantage with accepting this however, since most people are smarter than me regardless of gender.
