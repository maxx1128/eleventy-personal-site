title: "Where Will You Be In Ten Years?"
---
I was recently asked "where do you want to be in ten years?"

I had no real answer. I still don't.

But I don't think I need to yet. It's still early enough in my life. I can go in the right direction without knowing my specific goals.

Someone can know they need to head north, but not know exactly where for a while. But I need to get an answer ready when just "north" isn't enough.
