Excitement for new projects is like a whirlpool sometimes. At first, I'm cruising along feeling thrilled. Then I realize you're in too deep, obstacles are piling up, and it'll take a lot longer to get back to a stable place than you expected. Plus my lungs may overflow with alcoholic liquid and I drown.

In other words, I get sucked in and am in such a huge rush I either give up or settle for forced, haphazard changes. A few months later I look back, want to fix it all, and the cycle continues.

Not this time, especially since the project in question is revamping this very site!

Patience and incremental changes are the real solutions. What's most important is not thinking that this project will solve everything. **Success isn't one big step - it's several everyday steps.**
