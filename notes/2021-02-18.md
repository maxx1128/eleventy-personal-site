There will always be folks, real or online, where engaging with them only leads to exhaustion. They could be too set in their ways, don't care about listening, or [they simply want to exhaust you (known as sealioning)](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/01/sealioning/).

This may or may not be their intention. They could be good or bad people. I've probably been like that at different points in my life.

**But the best solution is always walking away, for your own sake.** This doesn't mean you don't keep learning and rethinking your position. But it's never because of the bad-faith arguers or the sealions.

Unless you're an emotional masochist. In which case, throw on that ball gag and head to the comments section.
