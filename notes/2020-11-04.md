America is still counting the votes, but it's a close race.

America is having a tough time deciding if they want to give a man, whose [pandemic response killed over 200,000 people and will likely kill at least 200,000 more](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-10-07-20-intl/h_8a1994962c6789e4ebc16bfe1f2aa99a), a second chance. You know, that guy whose poor handling shattered economic livelihoods and regular life across the country while other countries have beaten it.

That guy. He's the one who was also...

* [Impeached for inviting foreign interference in the election](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/impeachment-trump-intelligence-committee.html).
* [Bragged about sexually assaulting women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape).
* [Had his personal lawyer and fixer sent to prison for paying to silence a porn star the President had an affair with. While he was married](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12405623/michael-cohen-prison-donald-trump-lawyer-book-disloyal/).
* [Had his charitable foundation shut down for misusing funds donated for charitable purposes](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777287610/judge-says-trump-must-pay-2-million-over-misuse-of-foundation-funds).
* [Many, many other things](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-complete-listing-so-far-atrocities-1-964).

The country is having a hard time deciding if they want to give him a second chance.

Biden winning won't make any of that go away.
