By your very existence, you will anger people who want nothing more but to destroy you. You may never meet them, but there will always be people who loathe one (or more) things you stand for. No matter what you try to do to change them or yourself.

If that's the case, I may as well go down the path that makes me happy and brings me meaning. Whatever it is or whoever it pisses off.
