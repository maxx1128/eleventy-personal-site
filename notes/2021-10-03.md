At a corn maze this weekend, my group got a few maps of the maze. We could use that map to find all 30 hidden markers, or to get through the maze faster.

Getting a map before entering a maze seems counter-intuitive. Isn't part of the fun the aimless wandering until you somehow reach the exit?

One child felt the same. Over the corn stalks, we heard one parent say “the map is what keeps us safe.”

**The child yelled back, “the map is what keeps it from being fun.”**

We yelled "amen." Smart kid.
