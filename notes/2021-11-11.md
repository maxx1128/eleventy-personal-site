I believe each person has many things that, if someone does it, that person get crossed off their list. You can tell a lot about someone's personality, values, and even past trauma by their list. For example, someone physically bullied may cross off someone the second they get violent.

I have many of my own reasons to cross someone off my list. **But the most frequent one? Someone being a mix of dismissive, condescending, and smug towards me.** I can handle one, two if I'm in a good mood or they're an authority figure.

But all three? Good luck recovering from that. If I don't get basic respect, you don't get my time.
