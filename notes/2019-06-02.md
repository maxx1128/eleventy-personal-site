When you're trying to accomplish something, don't play television in the background. Ever.

It can't be completely tuned out. It divides our attention and pushes unneeded info into our minds. It's like breathing in polluted air - you can't directly feel the damage, but it builds up overtime and can be devastating.

Your attention and focus are your best weapons against any problem. Give those away, and you're letting others exert more power over you. These are people who only see you as a pair of eyeballs with a wallet.

Play music if you must. But never television.
