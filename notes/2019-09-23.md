Have you ever felt pressure to turn your hobby into a career or branding asset? That any activity has to have some tangible, profitable value instead of just doing it for joy?

I think this has sent my drawing hobby in a now-predictable loop of events:

1. Resume drawing for its freeform expression
2. Start thinking of ways to incorporate it more into my writing or programming work
3. Feel increasing pressure to do the above
4. Drawing suddenly feels like a work chore instead of a hobby
5. Give up drawing and look for another hobby to focus on

I don't know if the capitalism culture I grew up in is to blame, or just me putting too much pressure on myself. Whatever the cause, I know this mindset isn't healthy.
