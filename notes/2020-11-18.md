Taking action to help others is one thing.

Taking action because of other's expectations, real or imagined, is another thing.

An otter politician arguing to put littering parents in jail with their own filthy water to drink and bathe in is one more thing.

The first thing is good, and the second thing is bad. The second thing can sometimes be in charge, but it'll convince someone's mind the first one is and make that person miserable. The first thing is the one that should always come before the second thing, and not let the second thing sneak ahead.

The third has nothing to do with the other two, but I find it amusing.
