Risk looks different for many folks. For some people, risk is trying an unfamiliar dinner recipe to impress a first date. Or buying a book without first checking the reviews. Or investing their retirement fund in a speculative joke currency, hoping to sell if prices boom.

Risk is different for everyone, ranging from mild, to severe, to stupid. No matter where you are on the spectrum, remember to take some every now and then. **No one can live a full life without the occasional careful, or even careless, risk.**

If you're the type to risk on cryptocurrencies, I won't stop you. I'm all for things that make me feel better about my lower ~~idiocy~~ risk tolerance.
