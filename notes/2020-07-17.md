The quarantine has kept me away from my anime laser-cut artwork, which has made me sad. I'm happy to say I finally found the time, courage, and momentum to make some more. With two helpful quotes as I'm stuck inside for most of my time.

The local craft store may be closed, but I have lots of wood scraps saved up. They laughed at me when I hoarded it all, but I'm laughing now.

Granted, I'm crying at the same time, but still, I'm laughing!
