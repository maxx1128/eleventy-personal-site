Video games have taught me some good things:

1. The value of perseverance
2. How small choices can carry heavy weight
3. Grass is super-effective against water
4. Animal Crossing's Isabelle has underrated fighting power

They've also taught me a few bad lessons. Chief among those is **you only move forward in anything if you get more skilled.** You can't win without enough levels, the right weapon, or a well-placed cheat code.

In reality, sometimes I go forward by letting myself be...me. I'm already at a high enough "level." I just need to not try too hard and be authentic. Otherwise, if I don't believe I'm strong enough for whatever is coming next, others won't either.

Unless I'm trapped in a floating classroom with an obsessive AI that killed all my friends. Games have taught me then that I need some constructive hacking.
