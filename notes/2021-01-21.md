I recently finished "[Ready Player Two](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26082916-ready-player-two)," and I learned a few things about fiction writing. I learned books shouldn't have lengthy sections of:

* World-building exposition that isn't woven into the story. Especially in a sequel where the world has already been built for the readers.
* Excessive, unimportant trivia about, but not limited to, 70's teen flicks, Prince, or any Lord of the Rings middle earth-esque fantasy realm.
* Introducing characters that look interesting and promise some fresh dynamics, when they're barely heard from afterward with no development.
* Brooding over losing the woman you lost your virginity to. Most people, including the nerds in the book's target audience, get enough of that in their brains.

I'm glad I learned so much from this book. Now to find one that doesn't try too hard to (and not succeed at) being a Dan Brown novel.
