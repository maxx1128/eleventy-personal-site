title: "There's Always Something Better"
---

No matter how good something seems, I always find something better shortly after. A book that looks immersing later looks boring compared to another. Coding tools or frameworks I see one day soon becomes obsolete next to others.

It's an endless cycle of want disguised as need. Ending that cycle means truly appreciating what I already have. Never forgetting the value I saw in it from the start.

For new things, if I only feel a "need" something once I learn about it, chances are I don't really need it. The things I actually need, I probably already have and just need to remember.

_This note brought to you by an hour after work wasted browsing Nintendo Switch before realizing it was an idiotic waste of time._
