[The recent Alabama abortion ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html) got me thinking about other policy positions that match with "holding all forms of life sacred" and all that. When someone tells me they're pro-life, I'd expect them to also hold the following views:

* Universal, or at least affordable, and inclusive healthcare. So no one dies of preventable illnesses due to inflated costs.
* Affordable childcare and preschool education. Also universal education access, since it's one of the best ways to improve one's quality of life long-term.
* No death penalty or capital punishment, assuming there's no exceptions to "all life is sacred" that were conveniently left out.
* Global poverty aid to stop more prevantable deaths worldwide. This includes accepting migrants fleeing violence so they're not senselessly killed.
* Sex education and birth control to reduce the number of abortions. I'd assume someone who hates abortion would support strong measures that removes the need for many of them.

The less someone "pro-life" supports policies like this, the more I see them as simply "pro-birth." That's the much less pleasant position of "make women have babies if they can't keep their legs closed, and the rest is not my problem." Which is exactly as cruel and damaging as it sounds.
