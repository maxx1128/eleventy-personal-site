The pandemic has taught me many things, most of them infuriating or depressing. But with all the extra time inside my apartment, and my own head, I've picked up two good lessons.

1. Reflecting on the past is a great way to learn lessons and not repeat mistakes.
2. Wallowing in the past is a great way to forget lessons and regret mistakes.

At some point, I need to pull myself out from the past and take some steps forward. **Even if that's as simple as exhausting my body until I have no energy left to think about the past.**

My boxing workouts and outdoor runs are the main reason I haven't yet collapsed into myself like a quarantined neutron star.
