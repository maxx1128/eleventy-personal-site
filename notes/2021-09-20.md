If you have an overactive imagination that needs to stretch its legs, read some good fiction.

For a while, I thought the best way to blow off some mental steam was video games. Ones with open worlds and frantic action, like Saints Row IV or Breath of the Wild. Don't get me wrong, they're fun. But they never gave my imagination the workout it needed.

Books are better for two reasons: **you control the pace, and you control how you see it.**

Take any fiction book. Want to imagine a scene as a slow, sepia-filtered drama? Or a graphic novel-styled animation full of slapstick humor and visual gags? Or like the last video game you played, and think of what each character's gaming style would be like as they went?

For those with restless minds, books are forever underrated.
