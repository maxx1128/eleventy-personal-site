The more time you spend in your own head, the more important it is you **don't forget your filter when you actually speak.**

I spend so much time in my own thoughts and imagination, I'm normalized to so many things others wouldn't even consider sharing. The response to that sharing is never "wow, how creative!" It's "what the hell is wrong with you?" Or worse.

It's a hard truth to swallow, since we often fall in love with our own worlds. That itself is fine - just remember virtually no one else will.
