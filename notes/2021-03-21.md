I didn't want to own a business until I learned about bookstore bars. It is now my new dream.

One idea I have is a rotating book and drink special. You get a discounted drink if you read them with a certain book. **But the drinks and books in these specials rotate every day. This encourages people to try new things on both fronts!**

One day you'll want a discounted red wine sangria - but it comes with a copy of "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind." Or you're curious about "Untamed" by Glennon Doyle - but you're also trying a Kentucky Mule for the first time. The possibilities make my head spin.

New Haven has many book cafes, but no book bars, and I am ashamed. We can be the change we wish to see in the world! Especially if that change is creating more drunk arguments about why the Big Little Lies book is better than the HBO series.

And before you ask, there will be no non-alcoholic options. Take that crap over to Barnes and Noble.
