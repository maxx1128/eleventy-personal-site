You ever have moments where your mind is so restless and thirsty for something new, you get pulled into a spiral of browsing and reading? It usually ends with a purchase you forget about a week later, reading something you realize you don't care about, or hate that you wasted breakfast time on a dozen empty Google searches.

I invite you to guess which one of those is me right now.

With so much choice in society, it's easy to think "I need to find the exact kind of thing my mind is looking for." But finding something so niche can take way too long, and the more niche a desire is, the more likely is to quickly fade. So is the effort of chasing a ghost of desire really worth so little?

It's not worth skipping breakfast for, I can tell you that.
