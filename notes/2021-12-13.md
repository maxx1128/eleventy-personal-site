One would guess one of my all-time favorite soundtracks would be in a language I understand. Whoever this "One" is would be wrong. I at last found the original "The World Ends With You" soundtrack on Spotify and it still impresses.

I don't know at least half the words to "Ooparts" and "Hybrid" but I still want them for most of my workouts.
