I'm proud to live in one of the only countries to see [coronavirus cases spiking in over half the states, yet continue the reopening process](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/record-spike-in-new-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-six-us-states-as-reopening-accelerates.html). To be so attached to its unequal, overworked economy that it willingly sacrifices the health of the exploited.

Wait a minute, I don't think "proud" was the right word..oh, "ashamed" was the word I wanted! I'm ashamed of all that.

Thankfully, that mistake isn't getting hundreds of thousands getting sick and possibly dying. I can't say the same for some of America's other screw-ups, like [deep-rooted racism](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/30/865413079/what-do-coronavirus-racial-disparities-look-like-state-by-state) and [housing inequalities](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/25/881927152/denvers-sweeps-of-homeless-camps-run-counter-to-covid-19-guidance), sadly.

But for many, an outdated national identity is worth more than our strength and survival.
