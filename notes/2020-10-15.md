"Love the Neighbor" seems like a solid Christian saying for being a better person.

But how does the saying apply to someone in your neighborhood that's homeless? If you live in a pack apartment building, do you love just your immediate neighbors or everyone in the building? If you live in a gated, white Christian community, do you still love people outside it that you don't see often?

Isn't it just easier to say something like "love everyone around you," "love your fellow humans," or even "don't be a selfish jerk?"
