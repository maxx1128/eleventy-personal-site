Many themes in the book "[Anxious People](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GB475S/)" had me feeling...anxious. But none more so than this quote.

> Because the terrible thing about becoming an adult is being forced to realize that absolutely nobody cares about us, we have to deal with everything ourselves now, find out how the whole world works.

This is a routine source of anger and sadness for me most days. But in some ways, it's the most satisfying.

Every time I pay my bills, cook a meal, or schedule an appointment, I'm giving the finger to that voice telling me I'm a lousy adult. Each completed to-do list item is me saying "fuck you, being an adult is tough but I'm doing it" to the world.

But car maintenance doesn't count. No one can handle that well unless they're a mechanic. Prove me wrong, I dare you.
