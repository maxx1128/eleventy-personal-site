One big effect quarantine has on me is making it harder to write. Inspiration and focus are a lot harder when you're stuck in one apartment all day. So the hobby I rely on for learning and self-expression is also harder. Quarantine is turning me into a rock - stale, gray, and covered with an unknown but disturbingly high amount of bacteria.

So I twisted this struggle into a lesson. Quarantine gives me a harder time expressing myself, but also more awareness and acceptance of who I am in the first place. I'm stuck with myself, but I'm more comfortable with that person.

This all still hurts though, I can't deny that. But this buys me time to figure something else out. You can learn all the lessons in the world, but sometimes you just need some grit.
