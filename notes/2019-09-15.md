America could use a holiday like[ _Dia de los Muertos_, or the Day of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead). It's a Mexican holiday where people remember the lives of who they lost, put up their photos, give them offerings, and many other traditions that focus on giving to the dead.

Most importantly, it exposes people to ideas of death and mortality early and positively. Death is inevitable, so getting too fearful and anxious over it (after a point) just damages one's sense of self. A holiday like _Dia de los Muertos_ in America could help remove the excessive fear and self-preservation from America's culture.

If our loved ones can visit us in the living world like in _Coco_, well, that's just a bonus. One I absolutely want.
