title: "We Are Modern and Ancient History"
---

I look back on history and wonder what it like to live in different times. Times without:

* Internet
* Modern medical care
* Video games
* Books

I could research what those times were like forever. But I can never experience them the same way. I can't walk down a road from the past, living in an society untouched by today's technology. It makes the past seem archaic, and the present feel futuristic.

On the flipside, people centuries in the future will think the same about today. The future could be radically different in any way, like:

* Colonization of other planets
* Global devastation through nuclear war
* Enslavement via autonomous, power-mad AIs

People in the future could be looking back on the present, wishing they could find the experiences we take for granted each day. They could long to know what it's like walking down a street of planet Earth without fear of radiation or robots looking to enslave them.

We are living the history people will someday wish they could go back and experience, even for a moment. How incredible is that?
