_Would you go off to help in the war effort, or help your ailing mother at home?_

The former is for a larger cause but with a smaller contribution. The latter is for a smaller cause but with a larger contribution. I'd argue a good life has a balance of these that takes the person's needs and circumstances into account. But what if you could only choose one?

I'm not going to ask Jean-Paul Sartre for advice here. I already know it's a tough decision I must make for myself. So what's my deciding factor?

I would make my own decision based on how much I specifically am needed for one or the other. There are many men who could volunteer for a collective task like war. But there are much fewer people, if any at all, in the position to do something like help an ailing relative of mine. The war effort will continue without me, but without me, there may be no one else around to take care of my mother.

That's my own answer. **To go with the small cause and large contribution if no one else can. Otherwise, go with the large cause and large contribution. But that's only if I'm forced to pick between one and the other. A healthy mix is still the best for the world and for ourselves.**
