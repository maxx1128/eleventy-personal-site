In 1790, the United States passed [the Naturalization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1790) to set the first rules for how a non-citizen becomes a US citizen. But the law was limited to "free white person(s)...of good character."

This was the same time slavery was happening in the United States, creating a huge gap in how citizens and non-citizens were treated. Understandably, new arrivals wanted to be seen as "white." Especially Irish, Italian, and German immigrants that were first seen as either "non-white" or just "partially white."

That didn't change over a century later when people brought the issue to court. In [the 1922 SCOTUS case "Ozawa v. United States,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozawa_v._United_States) a Japanese-American man argued he should be included under the category of "free white persons." A year later in ["United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind) an Indian Sikh man argued the same thing. Both lost.

The United State's naturalization laws have evolved since 1790, but race has played a key role. Society has defined [what it means to be white, how humans changed that definition, and racial privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States).

This is all in case someone dismisses the idea of race being a social construct as "absurd." Why pass laws and have court hearings over race if it's part of nature? Otherwise, we'd have witnessed the 1889 SCOTUS case "United States v. Gravity."
