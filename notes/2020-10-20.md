There are times I question the entire system of society we've built up.

I think of all the luxurious things humans created — television, movies, cars, airplanes, boats, video games, and the like. How many serious needs did they fill at first? Or are they things we only wanted once we knew about them? Then after having them around so long, we now think of these wants as needs?

Sometimes I wonder where the line between “unexpected need” and “manufactured desire” is drawn. Wherever it is, a big chunk of society always falls on the latter side. Then I ask, "how much is a society built on selling wants disguised as needs worth?"
