Do you think history and society would have changed if our sky was a different color?

Colors can have a large effect on our mood and imagination. A blue sky could have given humans made us calmer and sadder than we think we usually are. Red skies could hypothetically have fueled more feelings of power, rage, and lust throughout time. The result could be a world different in any number of ways - more sex-positivity or mass incarceration, polyamory as the romantic norm, still having slavery, or anything else.

What could have changed if the sky had been yellow? Or green? Or purple? Or polka-dotted? **Could such a simple change in the world have such a drastic change on human history?**
