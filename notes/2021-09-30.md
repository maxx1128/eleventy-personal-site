If you have a desk, pick a random item on it. Let's say it's a penguin plushie. **What if that plushie was not real, but a consistent hallucination? In the end, how different is it from something real?** You see and interact with it the same way as a real thing. Things would only change if someone else was there and said there's no penguin plushie on your desk.

But if you spent so much time thinking it was real, it wouldn't be easy to think otherwise. You may call them crazy and insist that thing is real.

What about if a group of humans in a town all hallucinated a giant penguin plushie? But someone visiting from outside the town said they couldn't see or interact with it. The town would call that person crazy instead of seeing they suffered from a group psychosis. So in that town, how different is that imagined giant penguin plushie from a real one?

Is reality about something existing outside of our perceptions? Or is it more about a kind of collective awareness and acknowledgment? If so, do collective thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions shape reality as much as reality itself? Or even more so?

It's an empowering thought. Then think of how those power can use this to manipulate and control others. That tilts it more towards terrifying. That's why we should only manipulate reality to make others see penguin plushies. It'd make the world improve at a slow but steady rate over the years.
