I want to love New Pokemon Snap, I do. But all [the game's grinding and repetition](https://www.thegamer.com/new-pokemon-snap-level-grind-long-game/) turns its huge scope against itself. I can only play the game in small doses. Otherwise, the joy turns into not being able to hit a Pokemon _just right_ after a five-minute setup. Then I need to repeat it all three times.

The upside is I've already finished my main goal. **That goal is, of course, photographing all the Eevee evolutions.** This was 80% of my reason for playing at all.

So even if I stop playing sooner than expected, I have no regrets. Other than goading a Pigeot to soar off with a Magikarp, and presumably devour it, several times. I still see its ghost in my dreams. Flopping. Gaping. Gasping. Screaming a silent scream for mercy.

Anyway...I photographed all the Eevee evolutions!
