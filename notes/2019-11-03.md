There's many times that, when left alone with my own thoughts, I feel nothing but dread. Whatever the topic is, touching on it opens a gaping chasm beneath me only separeted by something thin, fragile, and invisible. It happens mostly on Sunday nights and I don't know why.

I think it's best to hold onto those topics. A path or idea that scares me is always worth exploring. **I either find something I should have embraced sooner or will know, with certainty, to avoid.** The end result is always worth it.

However, finding these potential paths is actually easy. The hardest part is gathering the guts to follow them.

Still working on that. I may just be at my most cowardly on Sunday evenings.
