Some signs you're in a bad mood:

* Your thoughts are framed as blaming the world. For example, "it's the world's fault I'm dealing with X."
* You make broad, inaccurate, and usually negative claims about yourself. You could disprove them by remembering parts of your past, but prefer to wallow in self-pity.
* Reading news or social media you feel better.
* You pass by windows / sculptures / lampposts / anything and want to break them with your hands / feet / head / iron pipes.
* You worry making eye contact with others will anger them.
* You see the society of mole people declaring war on the humans as an improvement.
* You don't feel any different writing JavaScript.

These may just apply to me. Regardless, they're good to remember to hopefully catch your bad mood early. Eat a cookie, get to bed early, and dream of rainbows until it's over.
