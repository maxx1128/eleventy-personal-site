You know all the random background and text color combinations you see in my site? The ones in the page headers, or notes like the one you're now reading? I based each one  [on different Pokemons' color palletes.](https://pokepalettes.com/)

**There are twenty four different Pokemon behind all these colors. Are you a big enough nerd to guess them all for a grand prize of nothing?**

You can see them all in [one of my website's style partials.](https://github.com/maxx1128/eleventy-personal-site/blob/master/_sass/_generic/_pokemon-schemes.scss) But you should know that I chose them all and can't even name half of them when I see them here. So good luck!
