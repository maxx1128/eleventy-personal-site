As I try to finally finish "Last Night I Sang to the Monster," one quote jumped out at me.

> “I have a new theory", he said, "and the theory is this: if I develop a great capacity for feeling pain, then I am also developing a great capacity for feeling happiness.”

If this is true, then someone without little capacity for pain also has little capacity for happiness.

This doesn't mean we have to seek out pain if we're not happy. We all already have pain somewhere in us. It's a matter of finding ways to feel our pain that won't tear us apart but hollows us out. Once it's gone, we have more room for joy.

So I ask, what pain do you have for that? **That hollows you out without breaking you apart and letting the joy leak out?**
