For a long time, I've believed a person's value is directly proportional to the value they bring others. So only someone with money and useful skills is remembered, helped, and fought for.

I blame America's capitalism culture for putting this view in me, since Millennials are _all about_ blaming capitalism.

Then I realized being a productive robot isn't how to build good relationships. Why? **People don't befriend robots; people befriend compassionate, friendly people.**

So take that, capitalism. I finally freed myself a little more from your clutches.
