I love writing, but I also hate when I base too much self-value on others' reactions. Too much focus on my own, or even others' writing, can sadly cause this.

So taking a step away from writing, like blogging or Twitter (mostly Twitter) helps at times. Until I inevitably get too bored and start writing something else. The cycle continues!
