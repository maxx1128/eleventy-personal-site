Some workdays frustrate me unbelievable amounts. For example, if I'm dealing with local MySQL databases. But they're also the most exciting. I like learning new material, and these days remind me I still have plenty more to learn.

Now, will I focus much of that learning energy on databases? Maybe. I may refuse out of spite. Even if they're the main cause of these frustrating days.

Unfortunately, there are some lessons I may never learn.
