A common talking point in politics is along the lines of "give Americans their freedom and they'll solve it all. Their productivity and motivation are just waiting to be let loose.”

To that I respond, **seriously?** From what I see, most are happy to put their extra time towards noise and distraction. There’s a time and place for those, I admit. But they’re taking up a lot more than I’d expect is needed. If people had more time, many would just put it towards those distractions.

It’s good to compare the books “1984” and “Brave New World” here. The former argued freedom must be taken by force. The latter argued people given so many pleasurable distractions willingly give up their freedom.

Which one is closer to most societies today?
