I got a surprising tweet in my mentions recently.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait is this <a href="https://twitter.com/Maxwell_Dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Maxwell_Dev</a> from one of my graphic design classes <a href="https://twitter.com/NewhouseSU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NewhouseSU</a>? <a href="https://t.co/6NWznDJ4zD">https://t.co/6NWznDJ4zD</a></p>&mdash; Deb P Davis / ë°© ì—° í˜¸ (@yuncod) <a href="https://twitter.com/yuncod/status/1057438296366833664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2018</a></blockquote>

It's surprising for two reasons:

1. A major front-end blog, CSS Tricks, found my accessibility article worth sharing.
2. A university professor whose class I took as a sophomore still remembers me over three years after graduation. My graphic design skills then (and likely now) weren't getting into any galleries.

But I do remember Professor Davis from my time in Newhouse. Mostly from a Newhouse event where someone mistook her for a student.
