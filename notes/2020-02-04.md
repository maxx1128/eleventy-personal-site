A friend of mine has opinions on how asinine the American health insurance market is. They drove it home by imagining if the fire department worked the same way.

* While your house is on fire, you'd need to make sure the fire department you call covers that specific type of fire. If you live in an apartment, make sure they don't only cover house fires!
* The fire department would only put out a certain percentage of the fire. Then they'd ask you to pay for the water they'd use to extinguish the rest. If you can't afford it, you can either go bankrupt or watch your home burn down.
* After the tragedy is over, you'd get a bill asking you to pay the cost of the fire truck trip and the tools they used. Failure to do so means you're on your own if another fire happens.
* Non-fire disasters would be terrible too. Say you're stuck in an air vent or garbage chute. They'd refuse to get you out until they spend a few days confirming it's covered by your plan.

If all that sounds absurd and terrifying, _just imagine if we also needed insurance for the police department..._
