Here's a reminder to all the bloggers out there: it's healthier to be a selfish blog writer. Writing for others over yourself has many damaging effects, like diluting your real voice. But the worst is it needlessly gives other power over your happiness.

Fame and attention always go away, so relying on it never works in the long term. But knowledge and self-expression always stay with us and make us better.

If others happen to enjoy it, that's a lovely bonus. But it's never the paycheck.
