Like everyone, sometimes I'm struck by loneliness.

Like the single people among everyone, the loneliness strikes harder.

Like the socially awkward introverts among the single people among everyone, it's hard to handle the loneliness.

Like the writer/coder nerds among the socially awkward introverts among the single people among everyone, I create an anime image of the self-love quote that gets me through it.

May it also help others in this (admittedly specific) subset of people dealing with loneliness too.
