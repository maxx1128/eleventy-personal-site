To truly feel like I'm living life, it takes something that gives me meaning. Makes me feel I'm creating. Lets me build a new part of my internal world. These are the facets of existence worth defending the most.

Yet I feel my television call out to me and threaten to take them all away. With the entire Avatar: The Last Airbender series, no less.

Stay strong in the face of temptation, everyone.
