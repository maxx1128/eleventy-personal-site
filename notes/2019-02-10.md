title: "Limiting Cynicism"
---

It's easy for me to look at large-scale horrible news (repeating government shutdown, anyone?), and get so cynical I shut myself away with video games.

Those big problems will always be there. But it's more pragmatic to focus on the smaller, local things that are actually productive or can make a difference to someone.

Maybe not everyone, but someone. That's better than no one.

**Cynicism is another bad feeling pulling our minds like gravity. But it pulls us away from things that can alleviate that cyncism - meaningful activity, other people, and the liquor store. So pulling away is a daily fight.**
