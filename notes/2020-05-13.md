The coronavirus has reminded me that sometimes, things will just be horrible. Admittedly, it's been a while since things were _this_ horrible, but we still need to just let the world be horrible. We just need to do what we can to get through each day.

For example, I plan to get through the day by doing the following:

* Making chocolate pancakes for dinner
* Playing loud music for a 2+ mile walk
* Watching "The Office" as I clean the dishes
* Staring at the ceiling and not thinking

The outer world is horrible. I'm willing to make my inner world as pleasant as needed to get to tomorrow.
