Recently I tapped into my evil side and recommended [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe/) (DDLC) to someone. For those unfamiliar, it's a visual novel that starts cute and fluffy before eternally scarring you. So I highly recommend you, the reader, to play it now. Go into it knowing as little as possible for the best effect. I'll wait.

But when I think about it, doesn't DDLC reflect the current pandemic? It started mostly fine with some unsettling elements we couldn't quite pick out. Then there's a jarring shift full of death and insanity, with everyone getting picked off one by one.

I suppose the big difference is the game has tea, poetry, cupcakes, and cute girls. I never thought DDLC would be an improvement over the real world. But things are that crazy.

Now, are they crazier than Yuri? Let's hope the planet doesn't come to that.
