title: "It's Never the Right Time"
---

I've based a lot of my happiness around my environment being consistent. I hate it when my car needs repairs, my posters fall off the walls, or my furniture gets too dirty. My brain wants these things to be constant, so I don't need to worry about them.

Reality doesn't agree. Something always breaks and must be fixed or replaced. My environment is never "as it should be." Whenever things seem smooth, something **always** goes wrong.

One response is not bothering to try. There's always something wrong I could use as an excuse to not do what matters to me - to write. The lazy, scared part of my mind is drawn to them like gravity. I think all human minds are. It's a cheap, effective way to lower stress.

But it's not about things "feeling right" before I do something. It's about working around what's wrong so I can do what I want anyway.

These "it's not the right time" excuses aren't right, they're just easy. And the easy path is rarely meaningful.
