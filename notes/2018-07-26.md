An insight I sometimes remember comes from an unlikely place - [the Hello from the Magic Tavern podcast.](https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/)

Don't judge.

It was at the end of an episode with the homonculus made of bodily fluids (again, don't judge). Someone dealing with a chronic illness said the podcast's humor helped her through much of the pain. Even something as silly and pointless as an improv comedy podcast left a positive imprint on others.

**Maybe it's less about finding something new to help others, and more about helping others with what you already love.** If people pretending to be, among many things, a drunk wizard, a passive-aggressive shapeshifter, and a bitchy talking flower can do that, can't we all?

Seriously, don't judge.
