Even after we declare this pandemic "over," I [plan to wear a mask for the foreseeable future](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/04/the-people-who-plan-on-wearing-masks-forever.html). I have many reasons for this:

* Ending a pandemic takes concentrated, collective action. I don't trust America to ever fully deliver on this.
* It calms my paranoid side. This includes COVID paranoia, judgmental paranoia, facial recognition paranoia, and indirect mind-reading paranoia.
* Does my continued mask-wearing annoy you? You're likely one of the [folks who refused to wear masks from the start for petty political reasons](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53477121). Pissing you off is a pleasant bonus.
* It's made my seasonal allergies more bearable.
* I can mutter to myself or lip-sync music without worry.
* I accept that, at one point, it's a disconnected behavior that only makes me feel safer. But it's a better choice than binge-drinking or pot smoking.
* Even after all this, they still make me feel kinda cool and mysterious. I want to savor that as long as possible.
