We are living through the coronavirus pandemic.

We are living in the moments that could define the country for years. Moments that will have potentially seismic shifts in culture and economics. Moments that future adults will parse apart in infinite ways. Moments that will become history people imagine living through. Moments they wish they could have experienced.

This pandemic makes me feel a lot. Knowing I'm living through moments add in some fascination. **That spoonful of fascination makes the fear, anxiety, and bitterness go down easier.**
