My endless struggle to be an adult has hit a new obstacle: [hacked, customized Pokemon games.](https://pokemoncoders.com/) They are the perfect distraction for someone in my niche group:

* Loves Pokemon
* Hates the formula in ~~most~~ all Pokemon games
* Wants Rare Candy cheat codes to avoid level grinding
* Enjoys being able to speed up the boring parts, like random encounters and routine dialogue
* Doesn't want to spend $60 on an old game but with shinier graphics
* Likes turning on emulator filters so it looks like I'm playing an oil painting

Learning the patch process for many of these ROMs was a hassle, but was worth it. I already have [Pokemon Gaia,](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-gaia-gba-rom-hack/) [Pokemon Blazed Glazed,](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-blazed-glazed/) and [Pokemon Ultra Shiny Gold Sigma](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-ultra-shiny-gold-sigma/) queued up.

Bizarre names aside, I am both excited to play and hopeful I don't get too sucked into them. I have a plane trip approaching, and "I was hunting a Ralts at double speed" isn't the best excuse for not preparing.
