We haven't asked for the life we have. We didn't ask for our identity and its advantages and disadvantages. We didn't ask for the systems around us that keep those inequalities going. I don't think we need to blame ourselves for their existence.

But when we learn of them, do we work to change or remove them? Do we strengthen them and worsen their effects? Do we accept them as the norm and enable their existence?

I think it's fairer to judge, and even blame, people for how they answer those questions.
