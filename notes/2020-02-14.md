Happy Valentine's Day. Today I shall rant about books.

I gave "The Overton Window" a shot. I saw the author was Glenn Beck, the original political conspiracy theorist of my childhood. I accepted the funny looks others gave me and tried to read it like any other book.

I tried, I did, but couldn't finish. It wasn't due to any "liberal bias," it just wasn't a good book. There's many reasons for that, but here's two:

1. **The dialogue is too preachy.** It reads like a broadcaster reading announcements instead of people talking. It dialogue rarely drives change or development when it's a giant wall of ideas it expects you to accept and keep going. That may work for an Aaron Sorkin series, but not fiction.
2. **It takes too long to get to the point.** The book flap teases a massive, country-shattering event as the hook. Yet readers learn nothing until at least 45% into it, instead of the 30% mark at the absolute latest. When readers get bored waiting for the major plot events, you're doing fiction wrong.

I'm all for books having political views, and have read plenty along the spectrum. But I'm not for badly-written books.
