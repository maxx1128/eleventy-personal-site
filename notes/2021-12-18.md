Here's a simple way to tell if you're doing the holidays right. **It's measured by the less sleep you get, regardless of how much you plan, intents, or desire to get more sleep.**

Bonus points if your sleeplessness gets fueled by gift wrappings, panicked unwrappings with gift checks and rewrapping, clothing plannings, memorizing lists of "do's and don'ts," and hearing screams no one else can. You can spend those points on melatonin, weighted blankets, and knockout gas.
