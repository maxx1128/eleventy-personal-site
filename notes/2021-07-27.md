I have concerns with [this Richard Aldington quote from "Death of a Hero."](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/811566-adventure-is-allowing-the-unexpected-to-happen-to-you-exploration)

> "Adventure is allowing the unexpected to happen to you. Exploration is experiencing what you have not experienced before."

Let's say I accidentally drop a television on my foot and sprain my ankle. It meets the criteria for both adventure and exploration. It also doesn't feel as enjoyable as either one. It'd make for an amusing comic, but I don't know how much that helps its case.

You could argue some experiences are painful at first, but you're stronger in the end. The end result is positive, right? I agree, but the quote does not clarify this. So this "new and unexpected injury" loophole remains.

I'm now petitioning the quote to have a disclaimer for "net positive experiences." Otherwise, people that keep dropping dishes on their feet or banging their heads on doorframes will call themselves "adventurers." No one wants that. We deal with enough half-truths in dating profiles.
