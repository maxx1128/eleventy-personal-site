I've often been in the stereotypical "in my apartment staring at an empty file" situation.

Quick fix for this? Leave the apartment and go somewhere else. For example, I'm writing this from [an undislosed location filled with saws, lasers, power tools, and a burning smell in the air](https://www.makehaven.org/){:target="_blank", :rel="noopener"}. Sure I'm not writing anything interesting, or much at all, but it's more than nothing!

Home is for relaxation. My brain knows that, even if I have a hard time remembering it.
