As we mourn the loss of the Supreme Court's liberal icon, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I can already hear the hypocrisy attacks from either side.

* **Democrats**: You refused to appoint a justice during the last election year in 2016, but you're appointing one in this election year!
* **Republicans**: You wanted to appoint a justice during the last election year in 2016, but you don't want to appoint one in this election year!

The main difference is, in 2016, it was at the start of the year. This year the election's less than two months away. But that kind of nuance gets lost when party leaders focus more on discrediting the other and justifying themselves to their base.

As if we didn't have enough of that already.
