Things are getting better. Things are getting better. Things are getting better.

Things are still bad, especially outside my own state and the United States in general. But with increasing vaccinations, better ventilation and outdoor seating practices, and my own full vaccination, I can't deny things are getting better. Even if I don't know to what complete extent.

But after 14 months of pandemic trauma, it'll take some time and repetitive reminders to accept it.

So...things are getting better.

Things are getting better.
