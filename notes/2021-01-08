If you've found your best sense passion and identity, but don't express it since you're worried how others will react, I don't believe it's really your top passion.

I think the best sign is when you love something for the pain as much as the pleasure. When you could flame out and have everyone laugh at you, but you want to do it again.

Don't let the fear of what others _might_ say stop you from what you _should_ be doing.
