Unpopular opinion: I've missed waiting for Amazon packages.

Just after Christmas, I used some gift cards to buy some manga volumes. They only arrived a few days ago, so I waited for around a week. Knowing I was going to get something nice in a few days always brightened my mood. **It was having something pleasant to look forward to.**

In a way, canceling Amazon Prime didn't just save me money. It saved me from impatience. But mostly money.
