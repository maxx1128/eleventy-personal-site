Some consider vacation time for exotic travels and adventures.

For me, vacation is about relaxation and enjoyable work. It's remarkably easy to do this without the hassle of airports, reservations, packing luggage, travel schedules, food poisoning, sunburn, and those other things that make exotic travel "relaxing."

Some may think I'm wasting my time or youth by traveling less. To that I say, good thing I'm the one living my life and you're the one living yours. Not the other way around.
