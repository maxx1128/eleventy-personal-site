title: "Creativity is Just Better Problem Solving"
---
Good creativity doesn't occur in a vacuum from the "creative mind," whatever that means. It's not from a simple desire to make something flashy and get attention, since there's simple (and often annoying) ways to do that. Just look online.

Creativity is rooted in problem-solving. Solving interesting problems leads to creativty, since they demand interesting solutions. Which is more work than simply "thinking up something new." It's thinking up something new that gets a new job done.

I should ask myself a different question when bored. It shouldn't be "how can I be creative?" It's "what problem can I try to solve?" It can be big or small, as long as I find it just challenging enough.
