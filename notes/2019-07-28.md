Before I do something I want to do, I'm trying to first ask why.

Some are good, like wanting to be a better coder, getting enough sleep, and staying in (what I choose to think of as) decent shape.

Some are bad, like wanting to smoke various things, playing video games until my brain melts, and kicking random people after too much Twitter.

"Want" isn't enough without the "why."
