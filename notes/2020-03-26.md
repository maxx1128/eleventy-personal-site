I don't understand why people play video games with any type of grind. Whether it's a grind to gain levels, gather items, or decorate a virtual space you can only enjoy from a couch. Isn't there enough of that in real life?

I want video games for quick, fun, borderline surreal experiences I could never get in reality. Like fast-paced racing with crazy karts and items in Mario Kart Deluxe 8. Or wall-to-wall fighting in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Or spreading ink across a cityscape with a giant paintbrush in Splatoon 2. Or watching anime characters jump between a dystopian authoritarian hellscape and nuclear armageddon via time-traveling text messages in Steins;Gate Elite.

Call me a simple-minded or casual gamer if you want. I call myself someone who wants their escapist entertainment to be a real escape.
