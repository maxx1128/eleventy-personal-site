Sometimes, the toughest problems are the ones rooted in being alone. It doesn't matter if they're social, emotional, or physical in nature. At one point, your body is screaming that only having someone else near you can solve things.

These problems are tough since, no matter how much my focus goes to others, the solution isn't there. The urge to curl up and wait for a convenient savior does nothing. The solution still goes back to my own actions and responsibilities. My action of getting up or reaching out is ultimately what helps.

**That's not to say curling up and wallowing now and then is wrong. We're only human. But at some point, I need to clap my hands and try things for myself again.** No matter how much fruitless wallowing and screaming my body still wants.
