I've noticed Connecticut [may soon rely more on legalizing weed and online gambling to fund the budget](https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/lamont-proposes-legalized-marijuana-tractor-trailer-mileage-tax).

Imagine if you're a landlord with a bunch of tenants. The building needs some remodeling and maintenance, and you all want it done. But they decide to fund it by encouraging some to get high all day, and others to wager hundreds on if a stranger can throw a ball through a hoop.

I'm not saying they shouldn't allow either of those things. But when we as a major funding source for larger community needs? They may be the wrong behaviors to encourage for "the public good."

Except for getting high during the pandemic. Keeping people indoors, happy and stoned all day, is now a public service. They are the true heroes.
