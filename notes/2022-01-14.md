I spend a (worrying) amount of time reflecting on past choices and mistakes. It's a good way to avoid boredom since I'll always have more material. The most common thought I have while doing this is "how would my life have changed if things were different?"

It's a painful feeling to know so many other life paths are now closed off. Would they have been better or worse? Would they have been almost identical or wildly different? I will never know these answers until I get my multi-dimensional telescope patented and working.

But this image always makes me feel better.

**It's never too late to prepare myself for better life paths ahead.** No matter where I am now, things can get better. Especially once that telescope is ready.
