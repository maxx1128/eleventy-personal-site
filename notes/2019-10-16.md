Lots of people (mostly well-off white men) complain making sites accessible is tough and they don't want to do it.

I have many guesses for why they respond this way. Many guesses. Guesses I sometimes feel like yelling. Or guesses I want to spray paint on their garage doors. But I think the most powerful reason is they find it boring.

I'll concede things like semantic HTML, readable text, and keyboard interactions aren't as sexy as new JavaScript frameworks or GraphQL. But they're still part of the job. Our job as web developers is to, you know, **do the damn job.**

_It's frustrating since [I made this same point in a past article and need to keep sharing it](https://dev.to/maxwell_dev/comebacks-for-five-wrong-arguments-against-accessibility-5g5j)._
