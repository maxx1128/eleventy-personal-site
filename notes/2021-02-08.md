A while back, I read something shocking: [prisons use statistical data on third-grade reading levels to predict how many prison beds they need](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/an-urban-myth-that-should-be-true/259329/).

It seemed like one of those facts that's shocking due to not being well-known and revealing an ugly truth. Turns out I was wrong on both counts: [it's a common political talking point, and it isn't true](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/jul/16/kathleen-ford/kathleen-ford-says-private-prisons-use-third-grade/). But the article points out there's still a large connection between being able to read and dropping out or ending up in jail. So reading's importance can't just be ignored.

I write this both as a bookworm and as a cynic. As the latter, I know people will say "that specific connection is false, so we can ignore reading and education altogether!" **It's using language that sounds critical to disguise support of inequality and privilege.**

Language can be a bitch that way. It can slip by so many people yet drive society in so many different directions.
