[The book series "Feed"](https://www.amazon.com/Newsflesh-Trilogy-Boxed-Mira-Grant/dp/031622507X) features two adoptive siblings and their team blogging about their careers covering political campaigns and vast government corruption...around the time zombies walk the earth.

Between each chapter is a blog post or some other written communication by one of the characters. They range from articles they wrote, private letters to others, or unpublished glimpses into their streams of consciousness. Sometimes the writing is brief and lacks substance out of context.

For some reason, reading any of those posts inspires me to write more than anything. I think it's less about the content and more about the characters' clear purpose in what they write and why.

Do I often struggle to find blog topics since I'm not sure what my main purpose in writing here is? If so, I should at least have the same underlying purpose Feed's characters have in writing their blogs: finding clarity and meaning through writing.

If you're not using your own blog for that, then what _are_ you using it for?
