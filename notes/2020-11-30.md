I respect the leaves that, even now, are clinging to their trees.

Imagine you're one of those leaves. A deep, hopeless chill is falling over the land. Over many weeks you've seen most of your friends fall to their deaths. Your strength is slowly fading as the forces of nature pull you towards a mass grave. You look down at this mass grave each day as a reminder of your unavoidable fate of death.

Yet still, you cling to the tree. You know you can't beat nature, but you choose to spite it a moment longer. Now _that_ is perseverance.
