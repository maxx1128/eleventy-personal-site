I enjoy rewatching The Newsroom for its snappy, smart dialogue. Then I remember if a real person remembered and spit out so much mostly useless information, they'd mostly irritate everyone around them.

Our minds remember the information we find useful and cleans out the rest. Unless you have a job based around learning and presenting tons of information (like a big-league journalist) expecting oneself to meet those standards only makes you miserable. Even then, there's a limit.

If anyone gives you crap for not remembering every obscure detail of something you read one time a week ago, remind them you don't live in an Aaron Sorkin show. We keep the knowledge we find useful, like how to clean our showers, and clear out the knowledge that only serves to maybe impress others when we share it later.

If they protest, don't worry about their opinion. They can't handle the truth.
