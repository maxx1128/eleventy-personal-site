Humans could learn a lot from how plants live.

* Donâ€™t take more than you need
* Enjoy the sunlight
* Grow at a steady pace
* It's okay to have roots, even when everyone else seems to be moving so fast
* If a wild animal eats you, take solace in being part of the circle of life

Most important, it's normal when fruits or vegetables grow from your limbs.
