Give me a well-reasoned, logical, impassioned argument and I'll consider the points it makes. Give me that same argument, but with the speaker treating me like an idiot or a toddler, and I'll walk away before it's over.

It's a simple fact of communication: **if you don't speak to me as a human worthy of basic respect and intelligence, I have no reason to listen to you as one.**

If you treat someone like crap and expect them to listen without any pushback, most likely you are:

1. Stupid
2. Entitled
3. A jerk
4. Some combination of the above
5. Working at a cable company

Being upset by this isn't being a "snowflake." It's being someone who can set healthy boundaries and won't put up with your nonsense. There's no reason to be ashamed about that.
