One of the toughest questions I’ve heard is “where do you want to be in five to ten years?”

It’s hard to answer since there’s little about our future we can seriously control. Any number of outside events influencing our career, family, home, or love life. We just choose which events or opportunities to go with when they arrive.

I'd prefer to set broader goals or preferences for how to approach the future. Goals like "I want to work in this general field" or "I want to make family the main priority." But the more specific I set them, the more I risk setting myself up for failure. So I’ll avoid too-specific future goals for now.

Besides, I'm not sure what those specific goals would be right now. I'm lucky I've still got time to figure it out.
