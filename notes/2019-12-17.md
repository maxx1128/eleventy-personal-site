I have no issue with the "we're all brains in jars" theories if they're real. I can handle if reality itself is an illusion because of virtual simulations or a seriously bored demon.

My issue is with the reality I'm being fed. If you're going to feed me a fake life, either give me an unbridled paradise or a terrifying hellscape. This middling "distraction and anxiety-filled disintegrating society" version isn't cutting it anymore.
