I realized that my last note of "you can't have the 'what' without the 'why'" applies to why I write as well.

Do I post here for sincere self-expression? A desire for attention? Importance? Identity?

It's certainly not for clicks or ad revenue, so I have that going for me.

I am a selfish blogger. But writing anything for simple validation, from tweets to messages, is rooted in insecurity. At least selfish blogging indirectly helps others. If I'm lucky, it helps others more than me.

So this note is a reminder to myself: **don't mix up "selfish blogging" with "insecure blogging."**
