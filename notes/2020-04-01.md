Since the pandemic started, I've been thinking about this tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my therapist was saying her patients who have experienced trauma kind of accepted the new normal almost immediately, while those who haven&#39;t are still in anger, denial, and bargaining. i guess this is what that looks like.</p>&mdash; EricaJoy (@EricaJoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricaJoy/status/1241767936542425089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

I kept thinking about how trauma helped people accept a new normal faster. Does it not link someone tightly to any sense of "normal" since it was shattered before? Is it a greater sense of gratitude for anything, no matter how it changes? Or simply being used to tougher times?

As someone not well versed in trauma, I can't know. I just wish it didn't take that to give people a more flexible, collective mindset in tough times.
