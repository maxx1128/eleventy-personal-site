With recent Iran events in the news lately, I think it's good to remind ourselves how to spot war propaganda. [This article has lots of good points on what to look for in the news, why it's propaganda, and how to respond](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/how-to-avoid-swallowing-war-propaganda). I recommend the full article, but some of the takeaways are:

* **Don't just take government official at their word.** Any claim needs evidence that that's 100% correct, not "mostly correct" or "just trust me."
* **Don't let bullying mischaracterizations silence you.** People can twist any criticism of America's actions into "oh you must love the terrorists" to shut you up.
* **Don't let others change the focus.** Others will focus on how "strategic" or "hypocritical" a decision is instead of how "wrong" it is.
* **Imagine the same news from the other side about us.** This helps remove the distorting nationalism from our views.
* **Watch the language being used.** People will say "neutralization" instead of "assassination" since it sounds better, even if it conceals facts and is less accurate.
* **Remember what they used to say.** People starting a war now may have said their first strike a week ago was about "stopping a war."
* **Listen to the dissidents.** Watch for the same tricks from them, but still, find other sources. They help you fight the misinformation and break out of the bubble others want you in.
