What scares me the most is someone who refuses to change their mind.

So much of today's anger, dysfunction, gridlock, violence, and even death can often be traced back to one fundamental flaw in someone. That's being shut off from any new ideas, perspectives, worldviews, compromises, or solutions.

Their mind is shut off like a rock that'll eventually crash into someone.
