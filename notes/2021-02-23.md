I'm adding the phrase **"it makes sense when you think about it"** to my list of signs that someone is an ass. If someone drops this when talking with you, it sends the following messages:

1. Some basic critical thinking will let you figure out this topic.
2. I need to tell you this since you haven't given this topic any thought.
3. I, unlike you, have thought about it and come to a logical conclusion.
4. You should think next time and think more like me. Otherwise, you'll be wrong again.

It's an impressive, passive-aggressive way to call someone an unthinking idiot. It's even framed as offhand advice to give them plausible deniability.

My response to that is **I have thought about it, but came to a different conclusion.** We have different perspectives and sources of info, so that's not a surprise. But I am surprised this person's being such an ass about it.
