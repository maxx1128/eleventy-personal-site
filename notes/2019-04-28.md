Nice and good aren't the same thing.

Someone can smile and politely greet you while doing evil things like:

* Refusing service to black people
* Turning down an insurance claim so someone is bankrupted by simply not dying
* Firing someone for being a woman
* Wearing clown makeup
* Making you watch The Notebook
* Standing back and letting one group shoot another down

Don't let reasons like "keeping the peace" and "being a nice person" on their own convince you someone is good.

Good people regarded as heroes today were often scolded as rulebreakers before. Similar history could be playing out with them now.
