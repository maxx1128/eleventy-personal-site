One of my rules is I never trust my future self with needless temptation. An example of this is my 16GB private manga collection.

Why? My reading goals go out of the window when every volume of Eyeshield 21 is right there, waiting for me to read them for the fourth time. Keeping those comics out of easy reach, like on my tablet, is a big reason I've made good progress on my 2021 goal of 50+ books.

The temptation to add them back is always there, each day. But I need to keep it at bay for any hope of finishing.

Sorry, Hiruma.
