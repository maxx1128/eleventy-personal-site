I'm getting more mileage from [my Anime Quote Maker](https://www.quotemaker.maxwellantonucci.com/) than I ever expected. One reason why is I'm using it to build a stash of inspirational wallpaper porn. For example, this image with a quote from the NewsFlesh book trilogy about fear.

<img src="/assets/images/notes/quote-wallpaper-1.png" alt="A quote image about being scared so often, it eventually makes one go numb." class="block mx-auto width-75" />

A more recent one, and possibly more relevant these days, is this one.

<img src="/assets/images/notes/quote-wallpaper-2.png" alt="A quote about time and alcohol healing all wounds." class="block mx-auto width-75 sm--width-50" />

Both make me feel better when I see them on my computer. But in the long run, I think the second one will help more.
