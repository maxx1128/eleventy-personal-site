I'm getting more mileage from [my Anime Quote Maker](https://www.quotemaker.maxwellantonucci.com/) than I ever expected. One reason why is I'm using it to build a stash of inspirational wallpaper porn. For example, this image with a quote from the NewsFlesh book trilogy about fear.

!["A quote image about being scared so often, it eventually makes one go numb."](/assets/images/notes/quote-wallpaper-1.png)

A more recent one, and possibly more relevant these days, is this one.

!["A quote about time and alcohol healing all wounds."](/assets/images/notes/quote-wallpaper-2.png)

Both make me feel better when I see them on my computer. But in the long run, I think the second one will help more.
