In a pandemic, video games aren't the only good time-murdering diversion. Sometimes a little drawing is great to lower the buzzing in our heads. Colored pencil drawing is a favorite of mine, even on a tablet.

A bonus (for those of us with button makers and lots of free time) is the final drawings can be put on buttons. What fun is art if it can't be needlessly shown off?
