title: "Health Benefits of Violent Punching"
---

I've noticed my most relevant, powerful epiphanies happen during my boxing workouts. Somehow, bruising my knuckles against a heavy bag amid remixed pop songs helps my mind discover (or rediscover) important personal truths.

My guess is all-out boxing has a similar effect on my brain to alcohol - it lowers mental inhibitions so my thoughts flow more freely. The upside is, instead of embarrasing thoughts no one should ever hear, it affects useful ones related to health, motivation, and how I should write more.

So for all you naysayers who think there's no upside to violence, I'd argue in the right circumstances, violence can be quite healthy! And I'm sure this won't be plucked and twisted out of context at some point in the future, so I can rest easy.
