title: "Good Writing is a Habit"
---

When your main thing is writing, it's easy to get too caught up in reading and neglect the actual writing. It's true whether one wants to write code, blogs, or stories. Reading examples helps, but my best progress comes from actually writing.

It doesn't matter that writing's for a detailed post, or random thoughts in my pocket notebook. Writing is a muscle to use each day. It's is a habit I use to get through each day. It's not something to turn on-and-off when I think enough people are looking.
