I've gotten many reasons for why someone didn't reply to my texts. But recently I got my first "someone suddenly gave me a baby that got too comfortable and I couldn't get rid of it" excuse.

I consider it a modern adult milestone. It's also a good reminder that in a time when many people (like myself) cling to whatever digital or in-person interactions they can get, things like taking care of babies are still more important.

Granted, I should already know babies are more important than texting. But during social isolation and distance, a few reminders can't hurt.
