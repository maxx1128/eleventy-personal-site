Every now and then I remember that at any moment, some uncontrollable or unpredictable event could upend my life and set me on an irreversible new path.

It could be something good. It could be a new job, a new partner, a new family, sudden superpowers, or getting whisked away to a secret society that maintains orders in society's shadow.

Or it could be something bad. I could be thrown in poverty, important family and friends could die, I could lose limbs or senses in an accident, or be psychologically scarred for life by something like my apartment burning down.

All these bad possibilities make me want to chase lots of short-term pleasure. But if none of them do, I'd be destroying all the good long-term possibilities instead. I have surprisingly little knowledge or control over my future, and I need to make decisions for it all the time.

**We are all in uncontrollable ships flying in the chaos of the universe with no idea where we're headed, why we are, or when the ship will explode.**

But at least we have peanut butter. That always helps.
