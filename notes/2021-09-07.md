I have a long-running list of things that are so amazing, they're almost religious. I've included the lived experiences from many folks I've asked about it. Some items on it now are:

* A large slice of good cheesecake
* Blowing up random buildings in a video game with realistic physics
* Watching the end of "Coco"
* Eating pasta carbonara in Rome, Italy
* Kicking a nazi in the groin
* Winning any game in The Jackbox Party Pack
* Eating Portugese donuts
* Seeing Hamilton in theaters with the original cast
* Amazing sex
* Smoking weed
* Smoking weed and having sex while watching Hamilton on Disney Plus.

After a weekend in Portland, Maine, I'm adding something else: **lobster grilled cheese.**

Imagine how good this tastes. Now imagine something tastier. Then double it. That's how delicious it is. Get it now and you'll be praying to a new God.
