For the last month and counting, I've either been sick with or recovering from something. These include:

* Strep throat
* Facial surgery and scarring
* Fall allergies
* Mild food poisoning
* Twitter

My usual attitude to all these would have been "let's not work on anything serious until I'm better." **But when it takes weeks to reach the "better" point, it becomes less about waiting and more about wasting time.**

So while I'm still dealing with some mild things now, I don't plan to stop. This includes current goals like coding and MakeHaven projects and new ones like learning the piano.

Unless I somehow get strep throat again. That's more than an illness. It's a Satanic possession of the throat no amount of cough drops or holy water can cure fast enough.
