The way American society functions, it's easy to feel more like disposable assets than citizens. That makes it tough to develop a durable sense of self-worth. It also makes it harder to put effort into anything, knowing it could all be wiped away for profit at any moment. Human misery be damned.

We can't do much about that. Few people have any real control over how society sees its people. We have more control over if any specific people in it see us that way.

But if society sees us as disposable, aren't we more likely to see others that way too? Is it worth trying to change how others see us?

I'd say it's worth it, even if it's not easy. But the first step if not seeing yourself as disposable. Or what reason would others have to think differently?
