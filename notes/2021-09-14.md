If Netflix has taught me something, it's that "Wheel of Fortune" is only worth watching without commercials. It also taught me not enough animes get the official English dubs they deserve, but that's for later.

I'm serious. Each round is only a bit longer than the commercial break that follows it. Each half-hour would be around 33-50% commercials. How is that worth it?

Without commercials, each episode is short and sweet. It almost feels unfair how much casual game show fun gets packed into 15-20 minutes.

**Am I saying mastering time travel would be worth it to go back to when the episodes first aired and skip over the commercials back then?** No, but I'm _not_ saying that _isn't_ the case either.
