Even after I wrote about [the dangers of excess cynicism,](/posts/2021/02/12/skepticism-become-cynicism/) there are days I can't help it. I keep seeing news stories or anecdotes that show how America's institutions only look out for people that:

* Are working to exploit others through lies or lack of choice
* Are getting exploited to some degree instead of getting help

Part of my mind knows this is overly-reductive, black and white thinking again. But the other part of my mind runs with this and takes time and energy to calm down. The longer that takes, the more damage gets done. But after living through so many economic collapses, I can't dismiss it all.

It can't be healthy to always ask "how much of my societal paranoia is justified, and how much is exaggerated?" America offers no easy answers.
