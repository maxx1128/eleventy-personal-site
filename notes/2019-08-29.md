Reading _[How to Win Friends and Influence People](/exocortex/winFriendsInfluencePeople/index.html)_ has me thinking a lot. One of those things is this quote from House M.D., episode 16 of season 1.

> I’m not hiply cynical and I don’t make easy snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again.

The book often says the angry, unempathetic approach is easier and a person's first impulse. It's a lot harder to listen, see things from another's perspective, and persuade with empathy.

It's something to keep in mind when we see people attacking, dismissing, or bullying others. Those people are taking the cheap and easy approach to life. Anyone could do that. **Approaching life with empathy and an open mind is a sign of true strength.**
