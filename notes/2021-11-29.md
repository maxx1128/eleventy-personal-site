I find it dark yet funny when someone's response to "life in America is so expensive/stressful/unequal" is "move somewhere else." It implies there's no possible way for America to NOT be expensive/stressful/unequal. **It will forever be terrible for its citizens. You're better off leaving than trying to improve things.**

Bonus points if this response comes from an "America is amazing and free and you should love it" person. Put those two thoughts together and there's some amazing cognitive dissonance.

*"America is great, it's the greatest country in the world! But if you don't want a burnt-out life hanging by a thread, give up and move somewhere capable of doing better."*
