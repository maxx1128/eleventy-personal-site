It's easy to cling to old or outdated values. We could see ourselves as hypocritical, weak-minded, or opportunistic.

Do caterpillars feel this way when they become butterflies? Almost none of them do, at least according to caterpillar Twitter.

Change is natural, and we should embrace it. Even with vital things we thought would never change. Refusing it only holds us back.

We should at least try to be as good, if not better, than caterpillars. Especially since they still beat us at spinning silk and climbing walls.
