There's countless examples of someone saying something horrible and offensive, being called out on it, and the person dismissing the anger as "people unable to take a joke."

If it's a joke, people need to laugh. Angry is optional, laughter is mandatory. If a majority of people are angry instead of laughing, it's not a joke. At least not a worthwhile one. You're either a lame bullshit artist or a lame bullshit comedian. Or if you care about your "comedy" that much more than the feelings and lived experiences of other people, a bullshit human being.

No matter what, don't think "comedy" should mean the same as "immune from consequences." And get some new material.
