title: "Running Out of Music"

On [one of my favorite episodes of "Wait Wait Don't Tell Me,"](https://www.npr.org/2017/02/18/515781132/not-my-job-author-nora-roberts-aka-jd-robb-gets-quizzed-on-j-d-salinger) guest Nora Roberts dropped this wisdom:

> There are 88 keys on the piano, but do you run out of music?

For a creative pursuit like writing (and programming), a lot of my  creativity combines what I know and what I find. For example, what about combining programming and camels? It'll be the start of a new generation of coders who can work remote in a desert without a beer keg!

Correction: creativity is about new _and good_ idea combinations. Take one idea, research a new one, and see how well they fit. Rinse and repeat until famous.
