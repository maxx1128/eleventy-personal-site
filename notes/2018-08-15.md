title: "Smart TV Shows Still Make Me Dumb"
---

I've liked television shows like House, and recently Bones, since they make me feel smarter. Part of my brain has said I shouldn't waste time watching them. I rationalize that worry away by thinking about the show's intelligence. Shows based around critical thinking, puzzle-solving, and science can't be all bad. Right?

That rationalization has gotten weaker once I began accepting a few truths.

* Of everything I'd supposedly "learn" from shows like this, how much did I remember instead of it just washing over me? Little.
* Of the info I remember, how much of it is accurate, instead of being polished or simply wrong to increase the drama? Little.
* Of all the accurate info, how much did I critically think about in context, instead of being handed it as I unthinkingly down a plot path handing me answers? Little.

Ultimately, shows that make me feel smart are still shows. As almost any show does, they make me dumber, not smarter. It's the same for medical dramas, mysteries, and late-night comedy shows going over the daily news. They're made to entertain, not teach. It's why my brain's drawn to them more than articles or documentaries.

When it comes to my mental strength, I consider those shows honey traps: tempting, but better avoided. Resisting all that free nectar while watching others gorge is never easy. But it's ultimately better for me.
