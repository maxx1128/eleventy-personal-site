I have a theory why, for Americans, a vaccine is seen as the end-all Coronavirus solution. **It's because getting a vaccine asks the least from each person.**

Other countries beat Covid-19 by making smart investments in public health and following through on changes like social distancing and masks. It took work, resources, and people had to adjust to a new normal, but it worked. People are much less terrified of death and fewer people died.

Too many Americans would rather cling to "normal" and an "every person for themselves" mentality. It's easier for them, and if hundreds of thousands die, then _oh well._

It's a common theme in America, individualism to the point of absurdity and horror. "Land of the free" apparently includes "[freedom to needlessly kill more people than many recent wars combined](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/covid-19-has-killed-more-americans-than-the-5-most-recent-wars-combined-1.5115916)."

And still counting.
