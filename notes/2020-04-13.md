Part of capitalism is the endless pressure to not do something simply for the joy of it. It has to be turned into a career, a side-hustle, or a brand. Being stuck indoors can increase that pressure, with talk of "with all this extra time, you have no excuse!"

First, we're surviving a freaking global pandemic. Coping with that may take up most of my newfound time and energy. If you're someone who doesn't, know a lot of people lack your privilege.

Second, you can have a hobby just to have a hobby. Not everything has to be about a business or a brand. **Some things just make you happy. Isn't that part of being human?**
