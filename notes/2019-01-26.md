title: "Between Two Pokemon Side Projects"
---

With programming, there are times when I'm balancing time between two side projects. For example, these side projects could be:

* A Pokemon personality quiz on which Eevee evolution someone is, built on Ember to practice more complex services, writing all an app's tests on my own, and with touches of the Pokemon API.
* Building another Pokedex from the ground up with the Pokemon API, but this time with React as my first experience with a fuller React application and (hopefully) testing it.

When I'm torn between two weird Pokemon code projects, I know I'm in the right field.
