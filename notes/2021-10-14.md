The tech industry has many problems. Too many to list here. The big ones are diversity, bro culture, burnout, and people catching on to how we microchip them. But I'll focus on the diversity one here.

Maybe you're like me, a cisgender person that has never been personally affected by all this. If so, then you, like me, have a lot of research to do. I'd recommend these three resources:

* [A comic comparing gender and gender identity to ice cream](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/09/gender-is-kinda-like-ice-cream/)
* [Documentation on gender non-conformity, written by an amazing non-binary front-end developer](https://kittygiraudel.com/2021/10/08/understanding-gender-non-conformity/)
* [A massive collection of resources to educate yourself on diversity issues in the tech industry](https://github.com/sublimemarch/so-you-just-learned)

As an added bonus, check out [this cutesy romantic-comedy manga about high school students with various gender identities at a cross-dressing maid cafe.](https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/love-me-for-who-i-am/) It's adorable _and_ educational!

Also, when in doubt: **stop talking, start listening.**
