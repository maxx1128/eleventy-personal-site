A [recent article I read on burnout in hourly-wage jobs](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/6/20681186/fast-food-worker-burnout) mentioned how often people overlook chronic stress and fatigue in these jobs. The American ideal of "just work hard" makes many see burnout as the price of a better life.

While true in an ideal world, today there are a few things wrong with that:

1. These jobs rarely give employees a career ladder to "climb up."
2. Burnout causes long-term health issues like obesity and heart disease, which hurt workers and society long-term.
3. So many workers are so desperate for work and/or to support their families, they'll put up increasing abuse and can't just "find another job."

All that nuance is lost when others can simply chant "just work hard!" **It's today's version of "four legs good, two legs bad" - oversimplified and now meaningless, but great for drowning out calls to do better.**
