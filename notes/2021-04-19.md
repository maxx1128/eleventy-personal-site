Is the butt part of the legs?

My first answer was "no." However, it turns out the butt is a bunch of muscles that connect your legs and back together. So it technically is both part of the legs and the back.

So not only is the butt part of the legs, it is even more than that. It did not just meet, but exceeded my expectations! All butts truly are fantastic.
