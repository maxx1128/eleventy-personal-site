I'm still angry at everyone keeping us in this pandemic. Folks who are going to spring break parties, lots of indoor dining, and/or not getting vaccinated. Folks who are so desperate to return to normal, it pushes us further from it.

But I can also understand some of the feelings behind that. The frustration, depression, and isolation that drives this pandemic fatigue. Part of me knows public health, and my personal health, are what matter most. Another part has felt so scared and isolated for so long, it's hard to keep caring at all.

All I can keep doing is exercise, work, write, and whatever else until I run out of energy for fear and worry.
