I've enjoyed watching M. Night Shyamalan's _Old_, despite the usual horrible dialogue. I'm serious, I could write better dialogue after three cocktails. But something's been bothering me.

The reason the characters' hair and nails don't grow at an extreme rate on the beach is that they're made of dead cells. So only living cells get rapidly aged, right?

If so, why did the dead body that washed ashore decompose in only three hours? [Once a person dies, their cells die soon after.](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/when-we-die-does-our-whole-body-die-at-the-same-time/) So shouldn't the dead body stop aging so fast?

Also, hair and nail cells get made by living cells. [For example, fingernails get made my living skin cells.](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7762) Those cells should still be making their hair and nails grow at a faster rate, even if they don't age themselves.

Is there a more obscure, scientific reason to explain all this? Is it filmmakers twisting the logic for dramatic effect and makeup logistics? Am I overthinking things for silly reasons?

It may be a combination of a few of the above.
