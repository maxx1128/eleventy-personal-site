As much as I try to move away from drawing, it always pulls me back.

My guess is while programming and reading stimulate my left brain, anime and drawing stimulate my right brain. I need something I can throw myself into entirely without worrying about calm puzzle-solving or writing unit tests.

Programming and reading work out my logical brain. Nothing seems to hit my creative brain like drawing. It's short, intensive, and satisfying, like a round of boxing or an amazing unit test.

If a hobby keeps pulling you back no matter what else you try, it's a safe bet it's worth investing in.
