The best workouts meet the following criteria:

* You feel great afterward.
* You can't believe you just ran them.
* You never want to run them again.
* Near the end, there are either tears or raindrops in your eyes.
* There are at least three moments you want to scream.
* Something once living, now dead, is under your shoe. Bonus points if it's not an insect.

Sadly, I don't think anyone gets enough workouts like this. So when they happen, they should be treasured.
