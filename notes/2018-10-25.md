title: "Wasteful Words and Snark"
---

One of my worst habits (other than trying to make soup in an Instant Pot) is making side remarks just to get a laugh. Funny comments themselves aren't bad - but doing it mostly to get a laugh is.

Why, you supposedly ask? It's bad since it needlessly gives power to others. People can (and usually do) ignore my remarks or say they were annoying. Sometimes they're just being honest, other times they're jerks. The result is the same either way - The more validation I want, the more it stings after.

The lesson is it's better to listen, rather than pepper discussions with needless snark. Plus if I'm putting that much importance on snarky remarks, I have bigger problems. Problems with my self-esteem and the amount of TV I'm watching.
