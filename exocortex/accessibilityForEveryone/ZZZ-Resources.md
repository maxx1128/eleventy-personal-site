## In a Nutshell Recommendations

1. **Be Considerate.** Caring about accessibilty is the best way to integrate it into all your planning, and applying it to everything you need.
2. **Be Flexible.** Know where you need to make compromises, have constraints, and what lines to draw. Don't just not care at all, or dumb down each part of a site for accessibility. It's fluid, just like the web itself.
3. **Guidelines are just Guidelines.** You also need to understand your audience and their needs. Guidelines are good for not missing important details, and helping others understand accessibility, but they're not the main reason for it either.

Also, talk about accessibility more! Consider it a constant consideration for how we evaluate new tech.
