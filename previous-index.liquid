        <strong>As a programmer</strong>, I'm full-stack. I've coded the front-end for ten years with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ember, React, and have a speciality with design systems and web accessibility. I've coded the back-end for seven years with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and MySQL.

        <strong>As a writer</strong>, I write to remember lessons I've learned in programming, psychology, philosophy, and absurd topics that tend to confuse my friends.

        <strong>As a human being,</strong> I enjoy reading, running, drawing, crafting, and puzzle games. I don't enjoy paying bills, getting too little sleep, and fighting my inner demons of perfectionism.

        My blog is where I keep my big lessons. Sometimes they're important code knowledge or concepts. Sometimes it's career or life lessons. Other times it's broad changes in how I think. But they're all short stories taken from the novel of my life.
