There have been many posts about AI and large language models (LLMs) and how they can be either a threat or a blessing. I've found them to be useful tools, and this blog post captures why in a detailed, succinct way.

If you want an even shorter version, my rule of thumb for AI and LLMs is: **Use them for research and first drafts, never straight to production.** The technology will write pull requests and bug fixes outright one day. For now, it's best used as a tool to take fast first steps, learn topics, or answer questions too niche for Stack Overflow.

If the internet is a newspaper, tools like ChatGPT are freshmen staff writers, and humans are the senior editors. The staff writers are eager to produce new content and help. That's great, but they're still newâ€”we need to edit their work vigilantly before it gets into the paper.
