Yesterday was the Fourth of July, and I'd walked a few blocks to watch the night's fireworks. I was feeling frustrated about not finding as much inspiration for what I wrote. My writing was feeling more like a chore and less like a passion. I wanted writing something to feel as good as many people felt watching multicolored explosions in the night sky.

From what I observed, fireworks focus on powerful feelings and amplifying them to hit people harder and longer - feelings of freedom, wonder, spontaneity, and even power. Firing them for whole communities also spreads those feelings to many people.

**Then I remembered good writing and good fireworks are, to me, basically the same.** Aren't those two traits, amplifying and sharing powerful emotions, already key traits of strong writing? That's why thousands of people read fantasy novels like Game of Thrones - it's sharing those same powerful emotions with lots of people.

The writing I enjoyed most started with a powerful feeling, and the arguments and research came after. As logical as others have called me, my favorite writing from myself or others was always about self-expression as well as learning.

Each writing piece is like setting off a firework in my mind, and maybe even someone else's. What more motivation do I need to keep doing it?
