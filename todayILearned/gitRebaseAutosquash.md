Some Git commits may be made [solely to be squashed into other ones later on](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits). For example, you may add a commit meant to adjust or repair one further up the commit tree. **This can be simplified by making them `fixup` commits. These are commits marked specifically to be "squashed", or combined, into others.** They will automatically do so during a certain type of rebase.

This has been extremely useful throughout my career, but it has a few steps. They are well worth learning.

1. Track all wanted changes.
2. Run `git commit --fixup <commitID>` for the commit, with `commitID` being the ID of the commit you want it to be squashed into. You can see your commit ID's by running `git log`, with their IDs shown as long, random character strings.
3. The changes will then be committed with the same message as the commit you chose, but with the word `fixup!` prepended to it.
4. Run a git rebase with `git rebase -i -autosquash [branch]`. When the commits get listed, you'll fixup commits will be moved right next to the commits they're repairing. When you run the rebase with `:wq` they'll be merged, and the `fixup!` commits will canish.

You can set rebases to autosquash by default by running `git config --global rebase.autosquash true`. That way, you never need to pass the `autosquash` option again.

Lastly, here's a useful trick: to quickly find a recent commit when running the `--fixup` option, you can tell Git to get to find the most recent commit with a certain string. This command would be `git commit --fixup :/<string>`. So if you know the commit you want to fixup includes the word "chocolate", you'd run `git commit --fixup :/chocolate`. Put the string in quotes if there's any spaces in it.

Only use this trick when you know that git will find the commit youâ€™re thinking of in descending order. The more unique a string you use, the less risk it'll grab the wrong one.
