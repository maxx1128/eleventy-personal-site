Good typography is the core of all good website content, since it's how we read the words themselves. Good typography should also be invisible, so users aren't distracted by the letters from the content themselves. These are good approaches for doing that.

1. **A site's container types should influence type characteristics.** For instance, a site full of rounded shapes or containers should be paired with sans-serif fonts or characters with well-rounded shapes. Square or sharp-edged containers pair well with sharp, serif fonts.
2. **Save letter-space for your uppercase text.** In other words, lowercase letters shouldn't be the same height as uppercase ones. This seems obvious  and silly to do until you see websites using a kind of Copperplate font.
3. Save the more expressive, unique "display" fonts for headers. Their extra personality only works in small doses so it doesn't overwhelm users. Use simpler, more readable fonts for the body text to lower eye strain.
4. Use unitless measures for line heights. This lets it better scale with different font sizes. For example, a `1.25` line-height for an `16px` font size will create a line-height of `20px`.
5. Keep text lines between 45 and 75 characters long, including spaces and punctuation. This it the optimal range for readability, since it doesn't make users' eyes jumping to a starting line too often or too little.
