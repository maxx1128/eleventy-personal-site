        Hello Readers.

        <strong>As a programmer</strong>, I code for the front-end and back-end. For my work, I write a lot of JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I'm also building more specialized knowledge in web accessibility and design systems.

      <p>
        <strong>As a writer</strong>, I write to remember lessons I've learned in programming, psychology, philosophy, and absurd topics that tend to confuse my friends.

        <strong>As a human being,</strong> I enjoy reading, boxing, and some casual gaming. I don't enjoy paying bills, getting too little sleep, and fighting my inner demons of perfectionism and self-pressure.

        My blog is where I keep my big lessons. Sometimes they're important code knowledge or concepts. Sometimes it's career or life lessons. Other times it's broad changes in how I think. But they're all short stories taken from the novel of my life.
