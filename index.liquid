      Hello Readers.
    </h1>

    <p class="text-h6">
      Iâ€™m Max Antonucci. I write code, blog posts, notebooks, and musings.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>As a programmer</strong>, I code for the front-end and focus on JavaScript and web accessibility. I'm also writing more Ruby and Ruby and Rails.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>As a writer</strong>, I write to remember lessons I've learned in programming, mental health, philosophy, and life in general. Or random things I need to get out of my head.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-0">
      <strong>As a chainsaw juggler,</strong> I don't do anything since I don't exist.

  <p>
    My blog is where I keep my big lessons. Sometimes they're important code knowledge or concepts. Sometimes it's career or life lessons. Other times it's broad changes in how I think. But they're all short stories taken from the novel of my life.

    Whatever I want to write but can't quite fit into my blog or ExoCortex goes here. From the profound to the silly to the random, it shall be scribbled in a note.
